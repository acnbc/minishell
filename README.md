# Minishell

As beautiful as a shell - A 42 School project to create a simplified bash-like shell

## Description

Minishell is a minimalist Unix shell implementation written in C, developed as part of the 42 School curriculum. This project aims to deepen understanding of process creation, file descriptors, signals, and other fundamental Unix system programming concepts.

Key features include:
- Command execution with PATH resolution
- Environment variable expansion
- Redirections and pipes
- Signal handling (Ctrl-C, Ctrl-D, Ctrl-\)
- Built-in commands (echo, cd, pwd, export, unset, env, exit)
- Interactive prompt with readline support

The shell features an interactive prompt with command history, supports pipes and redirections, implements several built-in commands, and handles signals like Ctrl-C and Ctrl-D similar to bash.

This project demonstrates core systems programming concepts and serves as an excellent learning tool for understanding how shells work under the hood.

**Technologies**: C, Unix system calls, GNU Readline  
**Concepts**: Process control, File I/O, Memory management, Signal handling
